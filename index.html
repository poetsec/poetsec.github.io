                    <p>
                        I come from a professional background in restaurant management and information technology, and currently work in IT for a restaurant data company.

                    <p>
                        My first serious venture into the tech world started with building a PC. I spent months researching and learning all 
                        about computer hardware. My research sparked an interest in Linux, and it wasn't long after that I began modifying 
                        distributions and attempting to automate daily tasks with shell scripting. Linux led to shell scripting, shell 
                        scripting led to learning other programming languages, and I soon developed a passion for programming and information 
                        security.

                    <p>
                        Visual Studio Code is my main code editor. I am also familiar with Atom, Sublime Text, IDLE, and Visual Studio 
                        IDE among other editors. I use GitHub to store my code and work on projects there regularly and am also familiar 
                        with using command-line Git.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I mostly use Kali Linux for hacking, but I've used Parrot OS in the past as well. As far as hacking tools go, I'm 
                        familiar with Nmap, John the Ripper, Aircrack-ng, Wireshark, Burp Suite, the Social Engineering Toolkit, Metasploit, 
                        among others.

                        <p>
                            Outside of programming, hacking, Linux, and security, I travel, learn human languages, and spend time 
                            in the outdoors. I spent a few years living in South America where I learned Spanish, and began to translate
                            professionally between English and Spanish and study 
                            other languages in my spare time. I learned a good amount of Quechua (Native American Incan language) while living 
                            in South America, and try to help in the preservation of the language by gathering and developing digital 
                            resources as even proper books on the language are almost impossible to find. I also read Portuguese and have 
                            studied Dutch, Russian, Mandarin, and Arabic to some extent.
